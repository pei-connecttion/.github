# connecTTion — An Information System to Optimize Processes in Associations.

A unified ERP platform designed to centralize AETTUA’s operations (members, events, finances, and resources) and improve efficiency, transparency, and collaboration across teams.

## Why this exists

AETTUA currently relies on scattered tools and manual work. **connecTTion** addresses this by centralizing information and streamlining processes in one place, with a focus on data security, transparency, and scalability for future modules.

---

## Core Goals

- Build a functional prototype tailored to AETTUA’s workflows.
- Centralize membership, event organization, and financial control.
- Improve communication and collaboration between internal teams.
- Ensure data security, transparency, and accessibility.
- Provide a scalable foundation for future modules.

---

## Functionalities (MVP)

- **Member Management** — registration, updates, and member tracking.
- **Financial Management** — revenues, expenses, and financial reports.
- **Resource Management** — inventory of materials, rooms, and equipment.
- **Dashboard & Indicators** — quick view of key metrics (active members, events held, financial status, etc.).

> Future iterations can expand modules based on AETTUA’s priorities.
